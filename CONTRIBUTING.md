## Making Changes

### Skills
Each skill lives in `plugins/alive/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. Skills define what the squirrel can do — they're invoked by the user via `/alive:{name}`.

### Rules
Rules live in `plugins/alive/rules/`. They define how the squirrel behaves — these are always loaded and always followed.

### Hooks
Hook scripts live in `plugins/alive/hooks/scripts/`. They fire on session lifecycle events (start, resume, compact) and tool use events (pre/post). The hook registry is `plugins/alive/hooks/hooks.json`.

### Templates
Templates in `plugins/alive/templates/` define the schema for system files. The squirrel reads these before writing any system file.

## Guidelines

- **Read before writing.** Understand the existing code before modifying it.
- **Frontmatter on everything.** Every `.md` file has YAML frontmatter. No exceptions.
- **Don't break backward compatibility.** Existing walnuts must keep working.
- **Test with a real world.** Create a test walnut and exercise your changes.
- **Keep skills focused.** One skill, one purpose.
- **Respect the stash.** Mid-session writes are limited to capture and capsule work only.
